# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to add as much Loacker to the project as possible.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Adding a PR to add loacker.
* Being respectful of Ilan's insatiable hunger for the wafer.
* Accepting Ilan's devouring of hills of loacker wafers.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards Ilan's loacker hunger.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using Sambosak instead of loacker in pull requests.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at ilan@testim.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
